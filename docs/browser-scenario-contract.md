# Browser scenario contract

`capture_browser_scenario` accepts the provider-neutral
`browserScenarioSchema` through both MCP and the
`capture-browser-scenario INPUT_JSON` CLI command. The request is declarative:
it admits a fixed action vocabulary, explicit HTTP(S) targets, deterministic
browser settings, explicit storage seeds, and provider-owned
liveness deadlines. `INPUT_JSON` may be inline JSON or a JSON file path.

The minimal request contains only browser launch/connect selection, `start_url`,
and at least one `actions` entry. Launch `headless` defaults to `true` and can
be set to `false` where the host supports a visible browser. Navigations follow
the destinations named by the scenario and the page's ordinary browser requests;
there is no separate origin allowlist or request-interception layer. Environment
settings (including service workers blocked by default), empty storage, and a
final sanitized URL capture are supplied by default. Set
`environment.service_workers` to `allow` when the application requires them.
For attached browsers, `block` rejects captures when the selected page or its
frames are controlled by a service worker or already have a registration,
including after navigation. Existing caller registrations are never removed.
Navigation can run destination code before a newly discovered worker is rejected;
that rejection does not roll back browser effects. REA removes its owned
future-document scripts, restores live frame methods, then disconnects.
Add secret declarations, storage seeds, and additional artifact or event
capture only when needed. Action, secret, and storage counts are not capped.
Duration, action, and navigation timeouts remain fixed provider-owned liveness
limits. `capture.limits` controls retained event and network-content budgets;
it does not change those liveness deadlines.

## Minimal launch example

Save this as `browser-scenario.json`, replacing the executable path with an
already-installed Chrome-family browser and the URL with your running fixture:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "mode": "launch",
    "executable_path": "/absolute/path/to/chromium"
  },
  "start_url": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000" },
  "actions": [
    { "step_id": "settle", "action": "wait_for_timeout", "duration_ms": 100 }
  ]
}
```

```bash
oopsware capture-browser-scenario ./browser-scenario.json --json > browser-capture.json
```

The default capture includes the final URL. Select DOM, screenshots, or events
only when they help answer the question. Oopsware launches and cleans up the browser
profile for this request; it does not start your fixture server or install a
browser. A schema-valid scenario does not prove that the executable or target
is available on the host.

## Interaction example: capture the visible result

The default final URL answers "where did the page end up?", not "what did the
page show?". Many interactions, such as a search button that renders results in
place, change the page without changing the URL. A capture with only the
default `url` artifact then reports that the click succeeded and the URL is
unchanged, which cannot tell you whether results appeared.

Request the artifacts that answer your question and wait for the state you want
to inspect. This scenario clicks a Search button, waits for the current search
results, and captures the final DOM, accessibility tree, and URL. It assumes the
local page clears `#results`'s `data-state` while loading and sets it to `ready`
after rendering the current response. Adapt the selectors and readiness marker
to your page; an already-visible container or previous results are insufficient.

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "mode": "launch",
    "executable_path": "/absolute/path/to/chromium"
  },
  "start_url": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000" },
  "actions": [
    {
      "step_id": "search",
      "action": "click",
      "locator": { "kind": "css", "selector": "#search" },
      "timeout_ms": 10000
    },
    {
      "step_id": "results-ready",
      "action": "wait_for",
      "locator": { "kind": "css", "selector": "#results[data-state='ready']" },
      "state": "visible",
      "timeout_ms": 10000
    }
  ],
  "capture": { "at_end": ["dom", "accessibility", "url"] }
}
```

Save it as `browser-search.json` and run it the same way as the minimal
example:

```bash
oopsware capture-browser-scenario ./browser-search.json --json > browser-search-capture.json
```

Through MCP, pass the same object as the `capture_browser_scenario` arguments.
The final step's DOM and accessibility artifacts retain the page state at that
capture time inline. Oopsware still launches and cleans up the browser profile.

Action `timeout_ms` and `wait_for_timeout.duration_ms` accept integers from 1
through 2,147,483,647 milliseconds, matching the underlying timer representation.
Larger values receive an input error before browser launch. Omit `timeout_ms`
to keep an action pending until completion or request cancellation.

The click's `timeout_ms` covers the click action. A non-navigating `fetch` or
delayed render can finish later, so use `wait_for` to observe a page-specific
ready condition before final capture. A page that updates synchronously can
omit that wait. Oopsware does not infer application readiness from capture selection.

Choose captures by the question being asked:

- `dom` and `accessibility`: text or structure the page rendered, such as
  search results, validation messages, or updated lists. The accessibility tree
  is usually the more compact way to read visible text.
- `screenshot`: visual layout or styling, or content not exposed as text, such
  as a canvas.
- `history` or `storage`: navigation history, or cookies and web storage the
  interaction wrote. Request them only when that state is the question; they
  are never captured implicitly.
- `after_each_step` instead of `at_end`: intermediate state between actions in
  a multi-step scenario.
- `events` (`console`, `page-errors`, `network`, and so on): how the page
  reached its result, such as the request a search issued or an error it
  logged. Select only the event families you need.

Capture states are reported per artifact. An artifact you did not request is
`not_requested`, which means Oopsware did not look, not that the page had nothing
to show. A step's `completeness` of `complete` covers only the sections that
were requested. A URL-only capture can be `complete` and still be unable to
answer a question about rendered content, so add the relevant artifact and run
the scenario again rather than inferring from its absence. Capture completeness
also does not assert that the page's background work has finished.

The browser boundary is part of the contract. Launch mode requires a
caller-selected executable and always uses a provider-owned temporary profile
that is closed and deleted during cleanup. Connect mode accepts only an
explicit-port loopback CDP endpoint. The Playwright driver preserves this
distinction: it closes and deletes provider-owned profiles, but only disconnects
from an external CDP browser. Real-browser verification checks both outcomes and
confirms that an attached external browser remains alive.

That cleanup requires REA to remain running. Abrupt termination, including
Windows process-tree termination or POSIX `SIGKILL`, can leave the launch
profile and Playwright artifacts behind. A profile can retain cookies, history,
cache and origin storage. Later REA runs currently do not reclaim these paths.
Playwright 1.58.2 can also leave an artifacts directory when launch preparation
fails before a browser process exists, such as for a missing executable.
POSIX wrappers can request awaited cancellation with `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`;
Windows process termination is not an equivalent graceful-cancellation channel.
Do not identify owned artifacts by directory prefix or creation time alone.
See [#4659](https://github.com/morluto/rea/issues/4659) for the remaining recovery
and wrapper-cancellation work.

Keeping that browser alive does not guarantee its emulation state survives.
Chromium can clear caller-owned `navigator.platform` emulation when a page CDP
session disconnects, including sessions that sent no emulation commands. REA
cannot snapshot the other client's complete user-agent/client-hint settings and
does not replay a partial reconstruction. Use launch mode to keep this effect
inside a provider-owned browser, or have the external owning client reapply its
complete configuration after capture. Connected captures report this limitation;
see [issue #4089](https://github.com/morluto/rea/issues/4089).

`environment.locale` sets Intl formatting in both modes. Launch also sets
`navigator.language`, `navigator.languages`, and the request `Accept-Language`.
Connect preserves the caller's page and request languages; every attached
capture identifies this locale limitation, including retained partial
observations. Use launch mode when the application must select the requested
language through navigator values or request headers. Artifact completeness
covers the selected observations, not equivalence of launch and connect
language environments.

HTTP(S) URLs may include ordinary query values and fragments directly. Use
ordered structured query entries when a value needs to reference a declared
environment-backed secret. Form, storage, and cookie values are either literal
strings or declared secret references. Raw URL userinfo credentials are rejected.
Captured credential-header
values are not retained, and declared secret values are redacted automatically.
A secret may be declared solely to
redact matching observed content; every secret reference in an action, URL,
storage value still needs a declaration. Ordinary query values
and fragments remain intact. Durable results replace resolved secret values
with their secret references.

The exact `start_url`, navigation destinations, and storage-seed origins define
the inputs to a scenario; ordinary page requests are handled by the browser.
Storage cookies are scoped to the page URL at each capture. Unsupported action
tags, unknown fields, duplicate step IDs, and undeclared secret references fail
validation.

Cookies are installed before the initial navigation. Local storage entries are
seeded once per browser storage partition; session storage entries are seeded
once per origin in each top-level browsing context. Seeding occurs before the
first document scripts for that area. An origin first reached by a later action
receives its seed on that first visit. Application updates, deletions, and
empty values then persist across later navigations in the same area; a new
scenario starts with its own seeds. Partitioned frames can receive separate
local storage seeds even when they share an origin. The pre-script mechanism
uses CDP debugger instrumentation. The observer resumes only pauses whose top
frame belongs to its private seed script; page breakpoints and `debugger`
statements remain under the attached debugger client's control.

The result is Evidence with an initial state followed by one record per
declared action. Each step reports action status, elapsed time, sanitized URLs,
event bounds, and independently typed capture states for screenshot, DOM,
accessibility, URL, history, and storage. Console, page-error, network,
WebSocket, frame, worker, popup, and cancelled-download events are attributed to
steps. Retained events and requested artifacts are returned inline; omitted
events are counted by kind and identify affected network transactions.
Event and selected network-content retention have caller-selected limits under
`capture.limits`. Omitted values use the defaults below; every supplied value
must be a positive safe integer, and callers can raise or lower a default.
Byte limits are conservative allocation-cost estimates for retained event
values, including UTF-16 storage and JSON expansion, rather than serialized
bytes or a promise about exact process memory. `events.omissions.by_kind`
reports counts and reasons for omitted event kinds. Its
`network_transactions` rows identify affected transaction IDs and omitted
event kinds; `network_transaction_range` identifies the contiguous IDs beyond
the transaction limit. Omission metadata is bounded by the selected
transaction limit. Other missing sections remain explicit and make the capture
ineligible for equality claims.

The default limits are 10,000 events, 4 MiB estimated allocation for one
event, 16 MiB estimated allocation across retained events, 1,024 network
transactions, 64 KiB of body bytes per transaction phase, 1 MiB estimated
allocation for body redaction/base64, 1 MiB for retained header values, and
1 MiB for network metadata. The same limits are included in the capture
Evidence. Playwright materializes response bodies before REA can inspect their
byte length; `max_network_body_bytes` bounds subsequent retained copies and
does not bound the browser API read itself. A body that exceeds its selected
limit has an explicit `body-size-limit` or `body-allocation-limit` unavailable
state with the observed and allowed values.

Additional implementation bounds are 16 simultaneous network-content reads,
a 5-second deadline for each provider API read, and 2,048 live event-listener
owners. These are not caller-selectable. The concurrency bound queues admitted
content jobs and does not itself omit observations; a provider read timeout
produces a typed unavailable state, while exceeding listener capacity produces
event-kind omission counts. A preflight avoids body redaction and base64 copies
when the currently available event budget already rejects the body.
Concurrent reads may each pass that check before their events are retained;
their retained-copy work is bounded by 16 times the selected per-body
allocation limit. The Playwright response Buffer itself is materialized before
REA can apply that limit. Requested artifacts and retained events are returned
inline within the declared limits.
Attach-mode captures also declare the unavoidable pre-attach event gap.

Selected event families are observed on the root page and discovered descendant
popups, including nested popups. Popup lifecycle records are emitted only when
`popups` is selected. Launch-mode network observation starts at the owned
context before navigation, so popup document requests, redirects, and responses
are included once. Connected contexts can contain unrelated tabs: only network
events with a frame belonging to the root or a discovered popup are retained.
Initial popup requests without a frame cannot be attributed in shared contexts
and are omitted; attach coverage remains incomplete.

Playwright reports new popup Pages after their first navigation has committed.
It buffers early console messages and page errors, but the pinned API cannot
recover every earlier frame, worker, WebSocket, or download event. If one of
those families is selected and a popup is discovered, Oopsware reports the family gap
in `limitations`, marks `events` missing, and disables equality eligibility.
Later events remain available; no initial navigation is synthesized from the
popup's current URL.

Each request names the exact launch executable or loopback CDP endpoint, target,
actions, and capture behavior. Origin filters and environment-variable names
are included when the scenario needs them.
Launch owns a temporary profile; connect mode disconnects from the selected
external browser without closing it. The request itself defines the operation;
there is no additional Oopsware grant step. The browser and host still enforce their
own access and process rules.

## Network evidence

`capture.events: ["network"]` retains request, response, completion, failure,
and unfinished-request metadata. Select content independently:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "mode": "launch",
    "executable_path": "/absolute/path/to/chromium"
  },
  "start_url": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000" },
  "actions": [
    {
      "step_id": "run",
      "action": "click",
      "locator": { "kind": "css", "selector": "#start" },
      "timeout_ms": 10000
    },
    {
      "step_id": "ready",
      "action": "wait_for",
      "locator": { "kind": "css", "selector": "#done" },
      "state": "visible",
      "timeout_ms": 10000
    }
  ],
  "capture": {
    "network": {
      "request_body": true,
      "response_body": true,
      "header_values": true
    }
  }
}
```

All three options default to `false`. Any selected network content also enables
network metadata observation; listing `network` in `events` is then optional.
Each observed request object receives a capture-scoped `transaction_id`.
Requests sharing a URL remain distinct. Redirects link to the preceding
transaction only when it was observed; a null predecessor does not establish
that no earlier hop existed. Request events require both transaction fields;
an absent ID is malformed capture data. `redirected_from_transaction_state`
records `root` when Playwright observed no predecessor and `unknown` when a
predecessor exists but was outside the capture. A linked predecessor is carried
by `redirected_from_transaction_id` with no state field. Older captures without
the state field retain the conservative meaning that a null predecessor is
unknown.

`scenario.network_content` records the resolved content selection. Comparing
captures with different selections reports network evidence as unknown with a
recovery instruction.
Capturing more data alone does not establish a website change.

`network-content` events reference the exact request or response event through
`source_event_sequence`. They include independently typed headers and body
states. Captured bodies retain base64 bytes, byte count, media type, and SHA-256
of the retained bytes. Request bytes are those exposed by Playwright; a
`not_exposed` request body does not prove absence or complete multipart file
coverage. Response bytes are the result of Playwright's `Response.body()` API.
Playwright may satisfy that API with a credentialed follow-up load of the
request URL when CDP has no response body. Event and transaction references
identify the associated Playwright response object, but do not verify that the
retained bytes came from the original network transaction. Successful selected
response bodies include this limitation in the capture. These bytes are not
the compressed wire representation.
Headers preserve producer order and duplicates. Authorization,
Proxy-Authorization, Cookie, and Set-Cookie values are null with
`redacted: true`; ordinary values remain intact. Declared UTF-8 secret values
and their standard URI/form or JSON-escaped representations are replaced without
decoding unrelated binary bytes. Other encodings are not interpreted. Digests describe the
retained representation after redaction.

Only completed responses are read. At the end of the final step, observation
stops; requests still in flight emit `request-unfinished`, and their observed
responses have explicitly unavailable bodies. Already-admitted content reads
drain before browser cleanup. At most 16 reads run at once; queued work is
bounded by the selected network-transaction limit and by successful admission
of its request or response event. Each provider API read has its own five-second
timeout once it starts, so queue wait adds to total drain and cleanup time; this
is not a five-second total capture cutoff. Cancellation interrupts active reads
and queued jobs produce cancelled states without calling their provider APIs.
This drain does not wait for long-lived unfinished streaming connections and
does not refetch unfinished response bodies. Failed or unexposed reads retain
per-content states and make selected event coverage incomplete. Body events can
arrive during later steps or final drain; event bounds describe receipt during
the step, while the source event reference establishes the transaction phase.
Comparison attributes content, like every other event of its transaction, to
the step that sent the request (the receipt step when that request was not
observed) and excludes the sequence reference from normalization.
Playwright scenario capture does not supply initiator stacks; passive CDP
observation retains its own initiator evidence.

## Scenario comparison

`compare_web_captures` and `compare-web-captures` also accept two complete
browser scenario captures. Steps align only by exact, unique `step_id`.
Duplicate IDs, missing counterparts, changed action kinds, and incompatible
browser/origin capture context are returned as alignment failures. They prevent
an unchanged claim; observed differences may still prove a changed result.

The comparison records its full normalization commitment and SHA-256 digest.
Built-in rules exclude step elapsed time and event sequence/index fields,
compare screenshots by content digest, and compare DOM/accessibility captures
by normalized text. Network events are grouped by transaction without their
capture-local transaction IDs, attributed to the step that sent the request,
and compared as an unordered collection after caller rules apply, because
concurrent responses arrive in any order and can land in a later step; a
redirect retains the complete predecessor ancestry, including each hop's own
request, response outcome, and selected network content. Each transaction's
capture-local IDs, sequence/index fields, and content source-sequence anchor
are removed. Caller rules normalize retained strings before hashing. The
`preserve_redirect_transaction_ancestry` built-in rule fingerprints each hop
as canonical SHA-256 of `{ events, redirected_from }`: `events` is the sorted
list of its normalized event SHA-256 digests, and `redirected_from` is its
predecessor fingerprint or null for a root. Selected transaction fingerprints
are sorted for the step's network comparison. Temporary numeric graph indices
are lookup references only and do not enter the final digest. Missing or cyclic
predecessor evidence yields unknown comparability instead of an unchanged claim.
Other events keep receipt order. Optional caller rules are bounded exact-literal
replacements over named artifact kinds. Rules and artifact-kind lists are
sorted canonically before application, making the same policy reproducible
regardless of input order. Rules operate only on already-redacted durable
capture fields and are preserved in the result.

Each aligned step reports changed, unchanged, or unknown. Changed and unknown
action, screenshot, DOM, accessibility, URL, history, storage, and event
artifacts carry their normalized before/after digests and capture states.
Every changed or unknown artifact record is returned inline for each aligned
step. Missing, truncated, or mismatched capture coverage remains unknown
instead of being treated as equality.

`scenario.event_families` records the sorted, de-duplicated `capture.events`
selection. Captures with different selections report event evidence as unknown
with a recovery instruction, even when no selected family emitted an event.
Captures written before this field existed omit it, so their event evidence is
also unknown.

Network normalization also commits the removal of capture-local transaction IDs,
attribution to the requesting step, and unordered transaction comparison. These
built-in rule identities participate in the normalization digest.
